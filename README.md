# eTicket
PHP / MySQL based help desk ticketing application

This project envisages the development of [eTicket](http://www.eticketsupport.com) in the public domain and is retaining it's schema so that migration-less switch is possible.

The last released version of eTicket (v1.7.3) dates back to 2008-10-23 and further development of a v2.0 was slated to be in progress in their [community forum announcement on 2013-08-30](http://www.eticketsupport.com/announcements/eticket-update/msg33310/?topicseen#new). There is a [screenshot](http://oi42.tinypic.com/6eojt2.jpg) of it but no code publicly available as yet.

The code will be minified to the extent possible without affecting readability and development.

There will be no upgrade path provided and only the last released version's schema will be supported.

Code changes to accompdate latest PHP versions will be incorporated.

This code is licenced under GPL v2.0.
